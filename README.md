Elysian realm is ~~hard~~ fun üòâ. I made this web-based guide because ~~why not?~~ i challenge myself since rentry just a bunch of text and hard to do some styling üí©.


## FAQ

> Did you test all of this guide recommendation?

This guide based on [this link](https://rentry.org/hi3er)

> What Language you use and how long it takes?

~~Indonesia~~ Vue3 and TailwindCSS for styling. From commits history it tooks almost 2 weeks so something like that

> How to contribute to this guide?

If you want to update guide recommendation (signets, builds), **just make a new Pull request**. If you want to add some features, please read below:
